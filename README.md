page, making it simpler to create new wiki pages.

## Installation

1. Install this plugin following the standard Redmine [plugin installation
   guide](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins).
1. Look for the "New" button on any wiki page, just to the left of "Edit". To
   create a new wiki page, click on "New", type a name for the new page and hit
   Enter. The wiki page you are currently on will be used as the parent for the
   new page.
